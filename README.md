My name is Marek and I do deep learning for cancer risk prediction. My main interests are in (stochastic) optimization and representational learning with applications in classification and segmentation. I often read about generative AI as well. Also check out the website of the AI for Oncology group I'm part of at the Netherlands Cancer Institute: [aiforoncology.nl](https://www.aiforoncology.nl/)

#### Blog

Occasionally, if I find something interesting to write about such as my work as a PhD student or mathematical facts I found out I'll post them here.

## Experience

My main work is in Python, specifically Pytorch. I'm learning the ropes of becoming an admin on our huge (Linux-based, duh) GPU cluster. I have been speaking Dutch for the past ~27 years and speak some English and German as well. My Duolingo streak on Italian is over 450 days at the moment of writing. My professional experience included internships and part-time jobs as a deep learning engineer at a start-up, quantitative financial researcher at a pension fund, and a mathematics tutor for pre-university students.

## Publications and other publicly available work

Well.... This is were I'd put my publications if I had any ðŸ˜œ

## Personal

In my free time I'm an avid cyclist, mountainbiker, and runner. I also like to visit the mountains (although we do not have those in The Netherlands) to climb, hike, and ski. When I'm sitting down I like to read books about chess, economics and sometimes try to learn some extra mathematics by reading math textbooks. I used to live in Rotterdam, now I live in Utrecht.
