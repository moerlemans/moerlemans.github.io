# Marek Oerlemans

My name is Marek and I do deep learning for cancer risk prediction. My main interests are in representational learning and I often read about generative AI as well. Also check out the website of the group I'm in at the Netherlands Cancer Institute: [aiforoncology.nl](aiforoncology.nl)

### Contact

If you have any interest or ideas relating to my work or my interests feel free to reach out to me.

## Experience

My main work is in Python, specifically Pytorch. I'm learning the ropes of becoming an admin on our huge (Linux-based duh) GPU cluster. I have been speaking Dutch for the past ~26 years and speak some English and German as well. My Duolingo streak on Italian is 19 days at the moment of writing. My professional experience included a few internships and part-time jobs as a deep learning engineer at a start-up, quantitative financial researcher at a pension fund, and a mathematics tutor for high school students. Maybe if I am determined enough to figure out how to upload a real CV here, I will do it, but at the moment I'm not. Feel free to request it though.

## Publications and other publicly available work

Well.... Hopefully, this will not be empty for a long time :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

I have some stuff online on Google Scholar and I'll add it when I feel like it

## Personal

In my free time I'm an avid cyclist, mountainbiker, and runner. I also like to visit the mountains (although we do not have those in The Netherlands) to climb, hike, and ski. I also like to read books about economics and sometimes try to learn some extra mathematics by reading math textbooks. I used to live in Rotterdam, now I live in Utrecht.
